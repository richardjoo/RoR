This is my playground for RoR  :-)

hey, I am new to this.  So, don't expect anything fancy around here.

more info on Rails?  go to:  https://github.com/rails/rails

I mainly use dev branch.  so, if you want to check what I am playing with, you can come to dev branch.
I often use wiki.  so, you can check the wiki section too.
Thanks~
